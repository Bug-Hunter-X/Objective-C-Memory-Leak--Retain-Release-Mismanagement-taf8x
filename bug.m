In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the use of `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.  Consider the following example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

// ... elsewhere in your code ...
MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
obj.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
[obj release];
```

The issue is that `[obj release]` only releases the `MyClass` object itself, but not the string it holds.  Because `myString` is declared with `retain`, the `MyClass` object retained it. The correct way is to call release on the string before releasing `obj`. This will cause a memory leak as the `NSString` object remains allocated, preventing the system from reclaiming memory.

Another potential issue occurs when using `autorelease` improperly.  Over-reliance on `autorelease` without understanding its implications can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes, especially in complex scenarios with many objects and nested methods.
