# Objective-C Memory Leak: Retain/Release Mismanagement

This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C memory management issue and its solution.  Improper use of `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` can lead to memory leaks, which degrade application performance and stability.

The `bug.m` file shows the problematic code that leads to a memory leak.  The `bugSolution.m` file provides the corrected version with proper memory management.

## Understanding the Problem

In Objective-C, manual memory management requires careful attention to object lifecycles.  Failure to properly balance `retain` and `release` calls will result in memory leaks or crashes.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that each `retain` call is balanced by a corresponding `release` call when the object is no longer needed. Proper use of `autorelease` should also be considered.
